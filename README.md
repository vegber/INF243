Algebraic Coding
Error correcting codes enable new applications on higher protocol layers. 
Among such applications we find efficient distributed storage, coding for low latency transport protocols, private information retrieval, and distributed computation, including secure versions of these applications. 
The aim of the course is to provide the algebraic foundation for the design of codes for these applications, and to show how the coding schemes can be implemented.

Algebraic codes used in higher layer protocols in the Internet and in storage systems: 
- Distributed Storage Systems
- Transport layer coding for single path and multiple path communication,
- Coding for Private Information Retrieval 
- Coding for Reduced latency 
- Coding for Efficient and Secure Distributed Computation, network coding and index coding.

The student should have knowledge of: 
- Information theoretic bounds of achievable efficiency for storage systems and communication systems
- State of the art coding techniques for such systems

The student is able to: 
- Implement protocols for distributed storage in software 
- Implement protocols for Efficient and Secure distributed computation in software 
- Implement protocols for Reduced latency transport layer communication in software 
- Implement protocols for private information retrieval in software
- Optimize parameters for communication and storage systems according to a diverse set of criteria
