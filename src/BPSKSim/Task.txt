(1)
    Write a program that will simulate a BPSK communication system with unequal bit probabilities.
    Using your program, create data from which to plot the probability of bit error obtained from
    your simulation for SNRs in the range from 0 to 10 dB, for the three cases that P_0 = 0.5  
        (in which case your plot should look much like Figure 1.10), P_0 = 0.25 and P_0 = 0.1.
    Decide Appropriate value of N


(2) 
    Prepare data from which to plot the theoretical probability of error (1.24) for the same 
    three valuesof P_0. (Maybe: Combine these first two programs into single program) 


(3) 
    Plot the simulated probability of error on the same axes as the theoretical probability of 
    error. The plot should have (E_b) / (N_0) in dB as the horizontal axis and the probability
    as the vertical axis, plotted on a logarithmic scale (e.g, semilogy in MatLab)


(4)
    Compare the theoretical and simulated results. Comment on the accuracy of the simulation and
    the amount of time it took to run the simulation. Comment on the importance opf theoretical 
    models (where it is possible to obtain them). 


Coded BPSK Simulation: 

(1) 
    Write a program that will simulate performance of the (7, 4) Hamming code over a BSC 
    channel with channel crossover probabiltiy p = Q(sqrt(2(E_b)/N_0)) and plot the probability
    of error as a function of E_b/N_0 in dB. On the same plot, plot the theoretical probability
    of error for uncoded BPSK transmission. Identify what the coding gain is for a probability of 
    error P_b = 10^(-5)
